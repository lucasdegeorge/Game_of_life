# Game_of_life
C++ computer science project 

This is a computer science project in C++ done during my master degree.

In this project, we have implemented a simulation of the Game of Life. The simulation allows
users to see the behavior of cells in the game and to interact with the game by changing the
state of cells in the grid. 

The report (see project render) is structured as follows: In the first section, we provide an overview on how to
run the Game of Life. In the following section, we present the rules and implementation of the
Game of Life, including the algorithms and data structures used. The graphical user interface
is then explained in the next section, detailing the choice of using Direct2D and explaining the
global structure of the interface. The following sections focus on the initialization of the Game
of Life, through initial configurations and also using an Excel file reader, that allows the user to
create initial configurations at their own will. Eventually, we list the key binds that can be used
to play the Game of Life in an Appendix.
